NAME
    Catalyst::View::JavaScript::Minifier::XS - Minify your served JavaScript
    files

VERSION
    version 2.102000

SYNOPSIS
     # creating MyApp::View::JavaScript
     ./script/myapp_create.pl view JavaScript JavaScript::Minifier::XS

     # in your controller file, as an action
     sub js : Local {
        my ( $self, $c ) = @_;

        # loads root/js/script1.js and root/js/script2.js
        $c->stash->{js} = [qw/script1 script2/];

        $c->forward('View::JavaScript');
     }

     # in your html
     <script type="text/javascript" src="/js"></script>

DESCRIPTION
    Use your minified js files as a separated catalyst request. By default
    they are read from "$c->stash->{js}" as array or string. Also note that
    this does not minify the javascript if the server is started in
    development mode.

CONFIG VARIABLES
    stash_variable
      sets a different stash variable from the default "$c->stash->{js}"

    js_dir
      Directory containing your javascript files. If a relative path is
      given, it is taken as relative to your app's root directory. If a
      false value is passed to js_dir then no directory is used.

      default : js

    subinclude
      setting this to true will take your js files (stash variable) from
      your referer action

       # in your controller
       sub action : Local {
          my ( $self, $c ) = @_;

          # load exclusive.js only when /action is loaded
          $c->stash->{js} = "exclusive";
       }

      This could be very dangerous since it's using
      "$c->forward($c->request->headers->referer)". It doesn't work with the
      index action!

      default : false
