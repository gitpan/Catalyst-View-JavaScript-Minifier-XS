NAME
    Catalyst::View::JavaScript::Minifier::XS - Concenate and minify your
    JavaScript files.

SYNOPSIS
       # creating MyApp::View::JavaScript
       ./script/myapp_create.pl view JavaScript JavaScript::Minifier::XS

       # in your controller file, as an action
       sub js : Local {
          my ( $self, $c ) = @_;

          $c->stash->{js} = [qw/script1 script2/]; # loads root/js/script1.js and root/js/script2.js

          $c->forward('View::JavaScript');
       }

       # in your html template use
       <script type="text/javascript" src="/js"></script>

DESCRIPTION
    Use your minified js files as a separated catalyst request. By default
    they are read from "$c->stash->{js}" as array or string.

CONFIG VARIABLES
    stash_variable
      sets a different stash variable from the default "$c->stash->{js}"

    path
      sets a different path for your javascript files

      default : js

    subinclude
      setting this to true will take your js files (stash variable) from
      your referer action

              # in your controller
              sub action : Local {
                      my ( $self, $c ) = @_;

                      $c->stash->{js} = "exclusive"; # loads exclusive.js only when /action is loaded
              }

      This could be very dangerous since it's using
      "$c->forward($c->request->headers->referer)". It doesn't work with the
      index action!

      default : false
